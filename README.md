# Morse Code Decoder

There is two decoders, one using binary trees in C Language and other using lists, also in C Language.

The morse alphabet is not the real one, it is an alternative, but you can take the idea from it of how to decode it and use it to decode the other alphabet!

(The C programs and the codes are in portuguese)
